We want to store element $x$, each with an associated key $key\\in U$, where $U$ is the set of the universe of all keys. Normally we make keys to be natural numbers. Let $\\mathbb{Z}_n \\equiv \\{0,1,\\dots, n-1\\}$. The simplest hash table we can design is a direct address hash table.\n","- let $d:U \\rightarrow T$ such that for an element $(x, x.key)$, $key \\mapsto key$ and $x \\mapsto T[x.key]$, i.e. each element and is corresponding key is place at position key in the direct address table.\n","- Direct_address_insert(T, x): return T[x.key]\n","- Direct_address_Insert(T, x): T[x.key] = x\n","- Direct_address_Delete(T, x): t[x.key] = NIL\n","- all operations are $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\n","- The direct address works well if the universe of distinct key is relative small, since the number of slots in the table are $m = |U|$\n","\n","Normally the number of keys are large and we cannot reserve a slot for each individual key. Instead we use a *hash function* in the following way:\n","- $h:U \\rightarrow T$, such that $key \\mapsto h(key)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_m$ and $x \\mapsto T[h(x.key)]$\n","- the number of slots in the *hash table* $T$ is $m$, and the number of distinct keys we store in it is $n$.\n","- we define the *load factor*, $\\alpha=\\frac{n}{m}$, it could be $\\alpha > 1$\n","- we can have *collissions* in the hash table: $$\\exists k_1,k_2\\in U, \\,\\, \\text{with} \\,\\, k_1 \\neq k_2, \\,\\, \\text{and} \\,\\, h(k_1)=h(k_2)$$\n","- depending on the design of the hash function we could have few or many collisions.\n","  - The poorest hash functions maps all distinct keys into the same slot in the hash table\n","  - In *uniform hashing* the probability that each key is placed in each slot is the same, i.e. $$\\Pr(h(key)=i, \\,\\, \\forall i\\in \\mathbb{Z}_m) = \\frac{1}{m}$$\n","  - let $n_i, \\,\\, i\\in \\mathbb{Z}_m$ denote the number of elements on the same slot on the hash table. Then $\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i = n$\n","  - on average after inserting $n$ elements on the hash table the expected number of elements on each slot is $$\\mathbb{E}[n_i] = \\alpha = \\frac{n}{m}$$\n","- We can resolve collissions by *chainning*:\n","  - create a double linked list on each slot on the hash table when a collission happens and insert new elements at the beggining of the list.\n","  - Chaining_Hash_insert(T, x): insert x at the beggining of the linked-list $T[h(x.key)]$\n","  - Chaining_Hash_search(T, x): search for x.key in the linke-list $T[h(x.key)]$\n","  - Chaining_Hash_delete(T, x): delete the element with $x.key$ in the linked-list $T[h(x.key)]$\n","  - searching is $\\mathcal{O}(1+\\alpha)$ on average, since we have to traverse the linked list.\n","  - inserting is $\\mathcal{O}(1), since we insert the new element at the head of the corresponding linked list\n","  - deleting the first or last element at a slot is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ if we use double linked-lists, and $\\mathcal{O}(1+\\alpha)$ if we deleting a specific element on the linked-list\n","- choosing a hash function:\n","  - division method: $$h: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_m \\,\\,\\, \\text{by} \\,\\,\\, k \\mapsto h(k)=k \\text{mod}\\,m $$\n","  - multiplication method: $$h: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_m \\,\\,\\, \\text{by} \\,\\,\\, k \\mapsto h(k)= \\lfloor m\\left(k\\cdot A \\text{mod}\\,1\\right)\\rfloor \\,\\,\\,A\\in(0,1)$$"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":427,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716652533985,"user":{"displayName":"Panagiotis Rigatos","userId":"04452164350727433470"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"hUSO6VbldTeB"},"outputs":[],"source":["class HashTableChaining:\n","\n","\n","    def __init__(self, m: int):\n","        #
