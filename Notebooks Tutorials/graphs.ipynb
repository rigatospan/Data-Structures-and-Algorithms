    "- Breadth First Search (BFS): starting from a starting vertex we visit all adjacent vertices first and then those vertices adjecent vertices and so on. Here is a description of the algorithm:\n",
    "  - initialize all nodes as unvisited, i.e. visited = [False]*n\n",
    "  - start at a node starting_node and mark it as visited\n",
    "  - examine all the adjacent nodes of the starting node\n",
    "  - keep a queue with the discovered nodes that we haven't examined their adjacent vertices yet\n",
    "  - pop the first node of the queue and examine its adjacent nodes; if an adjacent node is not visited add it to the queue and mark it as visited\n",
    "  - continue as long as there nodes in the queue, i.e. there are discovered nodes that haven't been examined if they have undiscovered adjacent nodes\n",
    "  - additionally for every discovered node we can keep the time of the discovery and the parent node\n",
    "  - since we examine each node and its adjacent list once, the time complexity of BFS is $\\mathcal{O}(|V|+|E|)$\n",
